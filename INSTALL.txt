The installation of this package is based on the GNU autotools.

If you checked out the sources directly from the repository you first have
to create a configure script from the existing 'configure.ac'.
For this purpose go into the main directory of the package (where there is 
this file) and run the 'autoreconf' command belonging to the GNU autotools:

 cd sixt/
 autoreconf --install

This basically generates the 'configure' script (and some 'Makefile.in's).
In the next step you have to run the 'configure' script to produce 'Makefile's
for the compilation and installation of the software. 
At this point you also have to specify the installation directory. The default
setting on most platforms is '/usr/local', i.e. the binaries will be installed
to '/usr/local/bin', the libraries to '/usr/local/lib' etc. This setting can 
be changed using the '--prefix' option of the 'configure' script (see below).
Apart from the installation directory you also have to specify the location,
where the PIL parameter files will be installed. This option can also be set on
the command line or the environment via the 'PFILESDIR' variable.
If the software will be used by different users the parameter files should be
stored in the '${HEADAS}/syspfiles' directory (ususally root privileges 
required). For a local installation for the current user, the files can also
be stored in '${HOME}/pfiles'.
So for a local installation, e.g. type:

 ./configure --prefix=$HOME PFILESDIR=$HOME/pfiles

Now the 'Makefile's to compile and install the software should be available.
To continue type:

 make
 make install

If everything worked properly you can now use the software.
