Programming standards for SIXT (Christian Schmid, 2010/08/20)

- Data structures

* Each data structure ([NAME]) containing any pointers should have a
  constructor (new[NAME]) and a desctructor (destroy[NAME]). The
  constructor should either allocate memory for the pointers or
  initialize them with NULL. The constructor returns a pointer to the
  initialized data structure. It also has an error status parameter
  which is set to EXIT_FAILURE if any serious problems occur. The
  destructor should release the allocated memory. Both constructor and
  destructor use the corresponding routines of underlying data
  structures.
